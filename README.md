The code for Part One of my two-part article, *Flask Or Django? An In-Depth Comparison*.

Have you just gotten started with Python for the web, and are wondering which Python framework to learn or use for your next project? Then you've probably heard of [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), or both. Although there are other Python web frameworks, such as [Pyramid](https://trypyramid.com/), [web2py](http://www.web2py.com/), and [TurboGears](http://turbogears.org/), Django and Flask remain the most popular.

This series will offer an in-depth comparison of Flask and Django, looking at various factors. In Part One, we will compare their:

1. Popularity
2. Documentation and ease of getting started
3. Routing system
4. Templating system
